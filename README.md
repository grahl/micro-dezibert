# μdezibert 

μdezibert a.k.a. micro-dezibert is a fork from [Dezibert](https://github.com/claudehohl/Dezibert). For more information on the original project, please see Claude's [personal blog post](http://scratchbook.ch/2010/11/19/wenns-zu-laut-wird-dezibert-hebt-den-finger/) and the [Namics lab post](http://lab.namics.com/2011/03/namics-lab-dezi.html) on it.

## Building it

The goal of micro-dezibert is to provide a simplified version, which does not require detailed knowledge in soldering or electronics and uses few parts. Schematics and documentation will be provided soon. The following SparkFun parts provide a *preliminary* list of parts.

* 1x ROB-09065 Servo - Small
* 1x COM-00105 Triple Output LED RGB
** 2x 100Ω Resistor
** 1x 180Ω Resistor
* 1x BOB-08669 Breakout Board for Electric Microphone
* 1x DEV-09219 Arduino Pro 328 - 5V/16MHz or any similar Arduino
* 1x Random switch (any button able to be pushed when lever reaches maximum)



## Running it

Note: IP address, hostname and password have to be set to use the networking functionality.
